title: Sinatra Outdoor Activity Tracker
---

Overview

I have just finished creating another project using the Ruby language—an outdoor activity tracker using the Sinatra framework. 
With spring already here, and summer quickly approaching, I thought it would come in handy to have a way to log all of my outdoor 
activities and details about their locations. After all, nature has a lot to offer! 

Before I could dive into coding, I found that one of the most important tasks was planning out how to approach this project and app’s 
different functionalities. After thinking about the setup, I decided that a user would be able to sign up for an account, login, and 
once logged in, would be able to add a location and location details to their list of locations. Once a location is added, the user can 
add an outdoor activity, log details about the activity (time, distance covered, thoughts, etc.), and choose which location from their 
added locations the activity takes places in. The user can also see what locations other users have visited, and the users that visited 
them.
